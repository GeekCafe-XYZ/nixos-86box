# NixOS-86box
A nixos installation for computers to auto boot into windows 9x systems with the help of 86box.

| I created this install script for anyone who want's to take an old pc and turn it into AN EVEN OLDER PC. 

## How to install
1. Download [nixos 23.05](https://nixos.org/download)
2. Burn NixOS to a USB Drive
3. Install [I WILL EXPAND ON THESE INSTRUCTIONS ONCE MY VIDEO IS LIVE]
4. Log into your nixos account
5. Open the Terminal
6. Type in 
```
nix-shell -p git
```
7. Type in 
```
git clone https://github.com/GeekCafe-XYZ/nixos-86box/
```
8. Type
```
cd nixos-86box
```
9. Type
```
./install.sh
```
Your System will reboot and auto log into win98 account

I will be working on the install.sh code to make the installer build the win98 account. This will come out soon so please stand by.
